#  About Me:

Hey, I’m Diego! I’m a Full-Stack Developer with 2+ years of experience in web application development, specializing in the React ecosystem, Node.js, and styling with Tailwind CSS. I also work extensively with UI libraries like MUI and Shadcn.

I create responsive and user-friendly interfaces using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and build efficient backend systems with Node.js, Express, Prisma, Apollo, and GraphQL. My approach emphasizes both functionality and aesthetics for an enhanced user experience.

I work with SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL for data management and utilize deployment platforms like Docker, Heroku, AWS, and Vercel.

Currently, I’m expanding my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core!
