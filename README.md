#  About Me:

Hey, I’m Diego — a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building experiences that feel as good as they look. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects that blend solid engineering with clean, intuitive design — from high-traffic marketing sites to dynamic internal tools.

I love turning ideas into interactive, purposeful interfaces and crafting systems that stay fast, reliable, and maintainable as they grow. My work often bridges design and development, helping teams deliver products that are both beautiful and functional.
